- 👋 Hi, I’m @JA-Reis (José Augusto Reis).
- 👀 My goal is to switch careers. I want to become a systems programmer/developer.
- :green_book: I’m currently learning FrontEnd. I have studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I still haven't decided if I'm going to start studying frameworks using React or Angular. I'm also interested in studying BackEnd programming, starting with Java and C#.
- :computer: I’m looking to collaborate on FrontEnd projects that allow me to consolidate my studies in this area and meet professionals with whom I can work on future projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: joseaugusto.reis@gmail.com

See ya ✌️
